# Instructions for backend

- To allow the front-end to work and bypass cors from the chosen API, a backend server was created as a proxy for the restricted content.

- Here is the repository of the backend - https://github.com/jeylana/fx-js-backend

- To start up the server run `npm i express` and then run the server by writing the command `node server` in the root directory

- You can now run the front-end like normal `npm run start`
